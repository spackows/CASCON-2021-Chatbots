## About the workshop
In this workshop, participants will use Watson Assistant to create a chatbot that can play an ice cream guessing game:
- Player A - _The ice cream oracle_ - Thinks of a flavor of ice cream
- Player B - _The guesser_ - Asks up to 5 yes-or-no questions and then guesses the flavor

In this workshop, participants will build a chatbot to perform the role of Player A.<sup>\[1]</sup>
